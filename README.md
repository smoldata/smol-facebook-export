# Facebook contacts export

This form lets you download a CSV file of your contacts on Facebook. Yes, you can generate a similar export by [requesting an official archive](https://www.facebook.com/help/131112897028467) of your account, but the contact list _only includes names_.

Having your contacts’ names is good, but you can’t really do anything useful with the data. This form generates a CSV that includes names, birthdays, and Facebook ID numbers. Those numeric ID numbers can be used to rebuild your social graph network somewhere else.
